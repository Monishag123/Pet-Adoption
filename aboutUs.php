                <p>
                    Our goal is to make shelters the first place potential adopters turn when looking to get a new pet, ensuring that all healthy and treatable pets find loving homes. We do this by breaking down misconceptions surrounding shelter pets and celebrating the unique bond between every shelter pet and parent. We want to put an end to the human/street dog conflict by creating a humane and sustainable environment for animals with direct benefits to the people of this society.
                    We provide several key programs to achieve our goals: rabies vaccination, rescue and adoption, and community education for rabies safety and compassion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We rescue animals from cruel and abusive situations ensuring that animals are protected from harm and given a second chance.

                    Pets are unique and the most adorable creatures on the planet. Pets love us and give us the company. Owning a pet comes with various responsibilities, and it is a fantastic way of learning how to take care of somebody.
                    We have pledged to provide lifetime care for a few animals that can never be released back into the wild due to physical disabilities and grievous wounds, such as our primates which have lost limbs and eyesight. Lifetime Adoption of these will aid us greatly, since the expenses are fixed.

                    We will keep you constantly informed of the progress of the animal you choose to adopt.
                </p>
                <p>We invite you to visit the shelter to see the work firsthand and to leave your donation, or do transfer online.
                </p>
                <h5> Why would you go anywhere else?</h5>
                <p>
                    We provide them with a full veterinary check, we ensure all of the dogs up for adoption receive rabies and basic vaccinations, as well as preventive treatments against worms, fleas and ticks. Abandoned pets and stray dogs do not ask for much. All they need is another chance. Each year this chance has gives animals a new life through our adoption program.
                     If you have seen an animal on our list that you are interested in, please fill out our application.
