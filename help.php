                This is the fun bit! Using the search function on the homepage, you can start looking and refining your search to find dogs, cats and other pets. Select large, medium, or small pets, puppies, kittens or adult pets. You can also narrow your search by postcode, and a range of lifestyle options. Take some time to read the profile of each pet, get to know their personality and find out if they are the right fit for you and your lifestyle. You’ll need to consider things such as size, breed, activity levels, grooming requirements and training needs. If you’re looking at puppies and kittens, bear in mind that while they are super cute, they do require a much greater time commitment than adult animals.

              <p> <h3>Let them know you’re interested--</h3> 
                    Don’t delay in making contact with the shelter, rescue group or pound if you think you’ve found your match - there may be other people applying for the same pet. Prepare any questions you may have and get in touch. You’ll find contact information on the pet's profile page. Bear in mind that shelters are only staffed during business hours, while foster groups rely on volunteers who may only be available at certain times of the day. If you miss out, remember there are hundreds of new pets listed every day, so keep looking and set up an alert so you can be among the first to view any new pets for adoption.

                 <h3>Make your application--</h3>
                    The rescue group will generally ask you to submit an adoption application form. This gives them all the info they need to help you find the pet that’s right for you and your home. It may be that the pet you’re interested in has been adopted, so with the information you provide the rescue group may be able to suggest another suitable pet.
             </p>
             
             <h4>Meet and greet--</h4>
             <p>
                Once your application has been processed, the rescue group will contact you to arrange a time for you and your family to meet the pet. Some may also request a house check, just to make sure your fences are escape-proof and there are no potentially dangerous situations your new pet may get into.
